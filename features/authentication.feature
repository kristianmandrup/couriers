Feature: Authentication
  So that I can sign in 
  As a courier

  @wip
  Scenario Outline: Creating a new account
      Given I am not authenticated
      When I go to registration page # define this path mapping in features/support/paths.rb, usually as '/users/sign_up'
      And I fill in "user_email" with "<email>"
      And I fill in "user_password" with "<password>"
      And I fill in "user_password_confirmation" with "<password>"
      And I press "Sign up"
      Then I should see "logged in as <email>" # your work!

      Examples:
        | email           | password   |
        | testing@man.net | secretpass |
        | foo@bar.com     | fr33z3     |

  Scenario: Willing to edit my account
      Given I am a new, authenticated user # beyond this step, your work!
      When I want to edit my account
      Then I should see the account initialization form
      And I should see "Your account has not been initialized yet. Do it now!"
      # And more view checking stuff
